# ADR 20250827: Basemap and Tooling Choices

- Chosen package manager: **npm** with Vite + React + TypeScript for the dashboard app shell.
- Basemap during M1 uses a publicly hosted Protomaps PMTiles sample (`https://pmtiles.io/2018-10-30-sf.pmtiles`).
  This placeholder will be replaced by a self-hosted, global PMTiles dataset in a later milestone.
